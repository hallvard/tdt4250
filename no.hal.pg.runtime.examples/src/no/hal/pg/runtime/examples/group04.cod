			 description "It was a cold winter morning in the year of 963. The mist was covering the landscape like a thick blanket. On this day, the great Olav Tryggvason would be born - son of Trygve Olavsson and a future king, who would lead Norway to great prosperity and help Christianize the region.
<br /><br />
As king of Norway, Olav successfully united many regions of Norway. But there was an old man he never managed to persuade…
<br /><br />
In a small village in the southern parts of Nidaros, Sem Sæland IX was the ruler. In the 115th building of this village, lived his master wizard known as Hal. Everyone was afraid of Hal, as it was said he possessed dark powers.
<br /><br />
Not even the great Olav Tryggvason was able to persuade Hal to join his cause, as each time Olav went to his village, he mysteriously awoke in his fortress the day after.
<br /><br />
In the year of 1000, Olav and his entire army was wiped out by a tremendous force in the battle of Svolder, and no one lived to tell the tale!
<br /><br />
As you open your phone on this very day, you receive a message from beyond: “You are in grave danger, fellow traveller! Meet me in the center of Nidaros Square as quickly as possible! I’ll be standing on top of a giant pole. HURRY!”"
